# PianoGameProject
Our project was to build a single-player game similar to Piano Tiles - Don’t Tap the Black Tile.
We wanted to create a game that involved a piano since both of us love to play the piano. With
that in mind, we decided to replicate a very well known game “Piano Tiles” for this project. The
objective of the game is to tap on the white tiles as they appear from the top of the screen while
avoiding tapping on the black tiles. We used the keyboard as our input and the monitor as
output. The game consists of four columns, each of which are controlled by a key on the
keyboard (A, S, D, F). The player presses the respective key as the white tiles reach the bottom
of the screen. Upon hitting the key on a black tile, the player loses and and the game ends
